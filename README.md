I am Eksperimental and I am an Elixir developer.

- ðŸ‘¯ I contribute to the following open-source projects:
  - [Elixir Programming Language](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir): a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.
  - [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc/): is "the" tool to generate documentation for your Elixir projects.
  - [Phoenix framework](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix)
  - [The Elixir-lang.org website](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir-lang.github.com)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [Maintenance](https://github.com/eksperimental/maintenance): An app which aims to automatize tasks in codebases of the Elixir, Erlang, or any other project using a Git repository (only GitHub is initially supported).
  - [BeamLangsMetaData](https://github.com/eksperimental/beam_langs_meta_data): an Elixir library that provides meta-data for languages in the BEAM ecosystem. Currently Elixir and Erlang/OTP are supported. More languages will be added if there's interest.
  - [BeamMeta](https://github.com/eksperimental/beam_meta): is an Elixir library to programmatically get information related to BEAM languages.

- ðŸ”­ I'm also working on these projects that have are in a very initial stage:
  - [Buildable](https://github.com/eksperimental/buildable): An Elixir library providing a protocol to buid any term. Think of it as Enumerable for inserting, not only extracting.
  - [ExtendedTypes](https://github.com/eksperimental/extended_types) - An Elixir library that imports additional types to your Elixir modules.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for help with any of my open source projects.
